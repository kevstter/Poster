abstract = {A general method to remove the numerical instability of partial differential equations is presented. Two equal terms are added to and subtracted from the right-hand side of the PDE: the first is a damping term and is treated implicitly, the second is treated explicitly. A criterion for absolute stability is found and the scheme is shown to be convergent. The method is applied with success to the mean curvature flow equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a Hele-Shaw cell, including the effect of surface tension. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Ascher1995,
abstract = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes have been widely used, especially in conjunction with spectral methods, for the time integration of spatially discretized partial differential equations (PDEs) of diffusion-convection type. Typically, an implicit scheme is used for the diffusion term and an explicit scheme is used for the convection term. Reaction-diffusion problems can also be approximated in this manner. In this work we systematically analyze the performance of such schemes, propose improved new schemes, and pay particular attention to their relative performance in the context of fast multigrid algorithms and of aliasing reduction for spectral methods.For the prototype linear advection-diffusion equation, a stability analysis for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-order multistep IMEX schemes is performed. Stable schemes permitting large time steps for a wide variety of problems and yielding appropriate decay of high frequency error modes are identified. Numerical experiments demonstrate that weak decay...},
