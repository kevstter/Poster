# Computational Math Day 2016 Poster

This is the poster I presented at the SFU Computational Math Day 2016. The work in the poster is based on my masters research. In-depth information can be found in the Thesis-B repository, where a version of my thesis can be found. Samples codes can be found in the thesis as well as in the Research Codes repository.

The poster can be viewed in main.pdf. The other files should be enough to compile the tex document to use as a template as long as the document is set to demo mode or the includegraphics lines are commented out.
