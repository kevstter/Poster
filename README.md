# SFU Computational Math Day 2016 Poster

I presented this poster at the annual SFU Computation Math Day in 2016. The work detailed in the poster is but a snapshot of my masters research. Full details can be found in my [thesis](https://github.com/kevstter/Thesis-B).

The poster may be viewed in [main.pdf](main.pdf). To compile the tex document, it will be necessary to set to demo mode or comment out the lines that call includegraphics as the figures have not been included here. However, the codes generating the figures may be found in the [Research-Codes](https://github.com/kevstter/Research-Codes) repository.
